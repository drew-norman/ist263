    <h2>Who</h2>
    <p>My name is Andrew Norman. I am a 23 year-old senior studying French and Francophone studies with a minor in Political Science. I love studying French history and literature. I am also interested in government and diplomacy. Despite pursuing a liberal arts degree, I envision myself obtaining an MBA degree or a JD and entering into finance, consulting, or litigation.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Chevy Chase, Washington, DC. I was raised in a multi-ethnic Catholic family and attended public and private schools. My favorite memory from adolescence was getting my license at sixteen years old. I love romance, war, and science fiction novels. My favorite authors are Paulo Coelho, Kurt Vonnegut and many many more. I love cycling, swimming, walking and listening to music. I have an older brother in the process of applying to law school. Both my parents are college graduates; my mother, a native Washingtonian, shares similar interests to me such as film and music. When no one is around I like to get lost in old memories––laughing at all the pranks I pulled as a child and teenager. I am drawn to mysterious and shy people; I am sort of repulsed by dramatic narcissistic individuals. If I had to label my personality it would probably fall into the protagonist category. I love watching justice being served and have a longing to be involved in some kind of legal field. I was hesitant to share my political views but in recent times I’ve fallen more and more towards the conservative side. My favorite sport to do is skiing and to watch is baseball. I love my identity as an American but would be lying if I said I did not want to be a dual citizen. I love France, its culture, its permissive way of life and language.</p>
